We all know that **Ohana** means *'family'* in Hawaiian culture :family:. That's the reason why I decided to give this application that name. This application is meant for the personal and private use by individuals or families to help them manage their home finances :moneybag:.

It's nothing fancy at all. It doesn't even have a GUI (...yet). The main purpose I built this for was to help me performing very repetitive tasks I found myself doing week after week in my effort to keep control of my family finances.

I'm a software engineer and as such I decided to do something about it. I'm not an expert in Ruby, I come from a Java background :coffee:. I started using Ruby mid 2018, so I have no real experience with it at all but I can say that so far I :heart: Ruby. It is a powerful :muscle: yet simple language.

Ohana has several functions built in that anyone can adapt for it to work according to their own personal way of managing their home finances (that's why it is open source after all). I tried to make it as customizable as possible to make it easier to modify to your own needs.

To keep Ohana simple, I decided that it would read all the bank and accounts information from bank reports provided by you, the user. You only need to provide the CSV versions of your bank statements. You can download these CSV files directly from your bank to your computer and Ohana will read them from there. No need to connect to any bank directly and also no need to provide user names or passwords to anyone. Just download your reports to your computer, run Ohana and it will take care of the rest.

You can also decide if you want Ohana to connect to a Google spreadsheet and update it with the information that's been calculated. No need to give Ohana your user and password, Google takes care of that so your access information remains private all the time.

Do you buy lot of stuff from Amazon? :package: Would you like to get a summary report of your Amazon purchases and orders? Do you have an Amazon rewards credit card? :credit_card: Ohana can also read from your orders report from Amazon (downloadable from Amazon in CSV format as well, so, no need to connect to Amazon directly!) and match them with your Amazon orders emails from your gmail account to give you a summary of your expenses and rewards points spent in a period of time.

So, in summary, what can Ohana do?

- [x] Estimate your monthly fixed expenses.  
- [ ] Help you prepare your monthly credit card usage report.  
- [ ] It can connect to Google spreadsheets and update specific spreadsheets with the calculated data.  
- [ ] It can connect to Google gmail to get information about your Amazon orders and give you a summary report.

**NOTE:** This is still work in progress. I'm currently working on all these features myself and I will keep updating this repo as frequently as possible. You will know what features are ready by looking at the checkmarks on the list above.
