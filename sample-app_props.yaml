# that appear in you bank reports (csv files) in the description column.
# You can use whatever name you want for your expenses categories i.e. 'car_ins'
# in the example below refers to a car insurance expense, but you can select
# whatever names you like. These are just some expenses examples.

# In 'agreggate_accounts' option, you specify if you want Ohana to agreggate
# all the transactions accross different banks and accounts (in case you pay
# your expenses with different accounts, cards, etc).
# In case you have two or more services that are billed together, you can
# specify which ones are billed together so Ohana will consider them as a
# single bill.
