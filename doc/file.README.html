<p>We all know that <strong>Ohana</strong> means <em>&#39;family&#39;</em> in
Hawaiian culture :family:. That&#39;s the reason why I decided to give this
application that name. This application is meant for the personal and
private use by individuals or families to help them manage their home
finances :moneybag:.</p>

<p>It&#39;s nothing fancy at all. It doesn&#39;t even have a GUI (â€¦yet). The
main purpose I built this for was to help me performing very repetitive
tasks I found myself doing week after week in my effort to keep control of
my family finances.</p>

<p>I&#39;m a software engineer and as such I decided to do something about it.
I&#39;m not an expert in Ruby, I come from a Java background :coffee:. I
started using Ruby mid 2018, so I have no real experience with it at all
but I can say that so far I :heart: Ruby. It is a powerful :muscle: yet
simple language.</p>

<p>Ohana has several functions built in that anyone can adapt for it to work
according to their own personal way of managing their home finances
(that&#39;s why it is open source after all). I tried to make it as
customizable as possible to make it easier to modify to your own needs.</p>

<p>To keep Ohana simple, I decided that it would read all the bank and
accounts information from bank reports provided by you, the user. You only
need to provide the CSV versions of your bank statements. You can download
these CSV files directly from your bank to your computer and Ohana will
read them from there. No need to connect to any bank directly and also no
need to provide user names or passwords to anyone. Just download your
reports to your computer, run Ohana and it will take care of the rest.</p>

<p>You can also decide if you want Ohana to connect to a Google spreadsheet
and update it with the information that&#39;s been calculated. No need to
give Ohana your user and password, Google takes care of that so your access
information remains private all the time.</p>

<p>Do you buy lot of stuff from Amazon? :package: Would you like to get a
summary report of your Amazon purchases and orders? Do you have an Amazon
rewards credit card? :credit_card: Ohana can also read from your orders
report from Amazon (downloadable from Amazon in CSV format as well, so, no
need to connect to Amazon directly!) and match them with your Amazon orders
emails from your gmail account to give you a summary of your expenses and
rewards points spent in a period of time.</p>

<p>So, in summary, what can Ohana do?</p>
<ul><li>
<p>[x] Estimate your monthly fixed expenses.</p>
</li><li>
<p>[ ] Help you prepare your monthly credit card usage report.</p>
</li><li>
<p>[ ] It can connect to Google spreadsheets and update specific spreadsheets
with the calculated data.</p>
</li><li>
<p>[ ] It can connect to Google gmail to get information about your Amazon
orders and give you a summary report.</p>
</li></ul>

<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> This is still work in progress. I&#39;m currently
working on all these features myself and I will keep updating this repo as
frequently as possible. You will know what features are ready by looking at
the checkmarks on the list above.</p>
